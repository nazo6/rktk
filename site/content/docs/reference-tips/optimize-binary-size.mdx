title: Optimize binary size
---

## Adjust build config (`.cargo/config.toml`)

Here is an example of a binary size-optimized `.cargo/config.toml`. If you use [rktk-template](https://github.com/nazo6/rktk-template), you don't need modify it, as it is already included in the template.

```toml title=".cargo/config.toml"
[profile.release]
debug = true
opt-level = "z"
lto = "fat"
panic = "abort"
rustflags = ["-Zlocation-detail=none"]
codegen-units = 1

[unstable]
build-std = ["core", "alloc"]
build-std-features = ["panic_immediate_abort", "optimize_for_size"]
```

- `debug = true`

  This enables debug info. This make _ELF_ binary big, but the final binary flashed to mcu (UF2 file) is not affected. So it is recommended to enable this.

- `opt-level = "z"`

  This enables size optimization of compiler. This is the most important option to reduce binary size. For other options, see [cargo book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#opt-level).
  The documents suggets that `"s"` sometimes produces smaller binaries than `"z"`, but in my experience, `"z"` is always smaller than `"s"`.

- `lto = "fat"`

  This enables link time optimization. This is also important to reduce binary size.

- `panic = "abort"` and `rustflags = ["-Zlocation-detail=none"]`

  These two lines allow the program to simply stop at panic. This reduces the binary size.
  However, you will no longer receive messages in case of panic.

  Note that second line is only available in nightly rust.

- `build-std` and `build-std-features`

  By default, program will be compiled with precompiled `core` and `alloc` crates. By enabling this, these crates are compiled from source code with size optimization.

  These options are only available in nightly rust. Note that [these options cannot be used with `per-package-target` unstable feature](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/11898)
