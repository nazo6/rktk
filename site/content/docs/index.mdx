title: Setup
---

First, let's build an environment for using RKTK.

## 1. Install rust

RKTK is built with Rust, so Rust is required; there are various ways to install
Rust, but using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is recommended.

After install rust, make sure that the `cargo` command is available.

## 2. Install `uf2deploy`

[`uf2deploy`](https://github.com/nazo6/uf2deploy) is a command line tool to
convert ELF binary which is produced by rust compiler to UF2 file, which is
common for flashing.

Also, this tools can be set as
[cargo runner](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#targettriplerunner).
By setting this, you can just `cargo run` to compile and deploy to device.

You can install `uf2deploy` with the following command:

```sh
cargo install uf2deploy
```
