## Softdevice

Softdevice is a binary blob that provides Bluetooth stack provided by Nordic.

The softdevice has several interrupt levels and peripherals that are proprietary and accessing them from outside the softdevice will cause a crash.

Please follow the [nrf-softdevice documentation](https://github.com/embassy-rs/nrf-softdevice) and be careful not to access resources that are proprietary to the softdevice.
