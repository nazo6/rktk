The fastest way to develop keyboard firmware using rktk is to use templates.
To use a template, you need [cargo-generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate). Install it with the following command.

```sh
cargo install cargo-generate
```

Then, you can create a new keyboard firmware project with the following command.

```sh
cargo generate https://github.com/nazo6/rktk-template
```

When executed, you will be asked about the crate name, MCU to build, etc. After you answer, a crate will be created for your keyboard in a new directory.
Now let's go to this directory and build the firmware.

```sh
cd <your-keyboard-name>
cargo run --release --features right
```

Using the `cargo run` command will build the firmware into a UF2 file, and if your microcontroller is connected to a PC in bootloader mode, the firmware will be copied automatically.

Note that the `--release` option is used here. Without it, unoptimized binaries will be generated.

The template comes with default settings for corne keyboard. Since this is a split keyboard, left and right must be specified. This can be specified with `--features right`.
This feature is one example of following the Rust way. This behavior can be easily customized.
