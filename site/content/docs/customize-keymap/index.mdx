title: Keymap
---

'Keymap' is Rust struct passed to `rktk::task::start`. You can see definition at [docs](https://rktk-docs.nazo6.dev/rktk/config/keymap/type.Keymap.html).

## Keymap by example

Let's look at each item using the example below.

```rust
use rktk::config::keymap::prelude::*;

const L2SPC: KeyAction = KeyAction::TapHold(
    KeyCode::Key(Key::Enter),
    KeyCode::Layer(LayerOp::Momentary(2)),
);

pub const KEYMAP: Keymap = Keymap {
    layers: [
        Layer {
            keymap: [
              [  TAB  , Q     , W     , E     , R     , T     , /**/  Y     , U     , I     , O     , P    , MINUS],
              [  ESC  , A     , S     , D     , F     , G     , /**/  H     , J     , K     , L     , SCLN , QUOTE],
              [ L_SHFT, Z     , X     , C     , V     , B     , /**/  N     , M     , COMM  , DOT   , SLASH, BSLSH],
              [ L_CTRL, L_GUI , TG(2) , L_ALT , L2SPC , SPACE , /**/  BS    , ENTER , _____ , _____ ,R_SHFT,R_CTRL],
            ],
            ..Layer::const_default()
        },
    ],
    ..Keymap::const_default()
};

...

async fn main() {
    ...

    rktk::task::start(drivers, &KEYMAP, ...).await;
}

```

### Prelude

The first line imports prelude. This imports many items that are commonly used in keymap. You can see full list of prelude [here](https://rktk-docs.nazo6.dev/rktk/config/keymap/prelude/index.html)

### KeyAction

Next, we define a key called L2SPC. Since the keymap is just an array, we can define the key using Rust.

Now, a key in the RKTK keymap refers to a Key Action; a Key Action is a unit of operation, and a `Normal` Action is used for a normal key.
The action used in this key definition is the `TapHold` Action. This action has two key codes, the first defines the key to be pressed on tap and the second defines the key to be pressed on hold.

[KeyAction](https://rktk-docs.nazo6.dev/rktk/config/keymap/prelude/enum.KeyAction.html)

### Keycode

A keycode is a unit of key. For clarity, they are classified as enums, and `KeyCode::Key` is a so-called “normal key”. In other words, the first key is the normal Enter key.

The next key is designated as `KeyCode::Layer`. This represents a key related to a layer. Here `LayerOp::Momentary(2)` is specified, which means that Layer2 is activated only while it is pressed.

[KeyCode](https://rktk-docs.nazo6.dev/rktk/config/keymap/prelude/enum.KeyCode.html)

From what we have seen so far, we know that L2SPC is a “tap to Enter, hold to Activate Layer 2” key.

### Keymap

And finally, the overall Keymap is defined. The so-called per-layer keymap is defined as an array in the `layers` field.

Rust requires the length of the array to be fixed at compile time, which is read from the `rktk.layer_count` in the config file (rktk.json). If the value specified in the config file does not match the array length, a compile error will occur.

Here, fields that are not specified are omitted using the `const_default` related functions.
