## Features

Each function consists of an interface that abstracts it and a driver that
implements it.

This document provides an overview of each function and the drivers that are
easily available in the official version. Drivers can be easily implemented by
yourself.

### About drivers

A list of drivers is shown on each feature page, some of which are only
available on certain platforms. For example, SoftDevice, which provides BLE
functionality, is proprietary to nordic and can only be used on nrf platforms.

On the other hand, some drivers are available for all platforms. These drivers
are compatible with [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy) and the
rest of the Rust ecosystem, and can be found in the “Common” section.

For a detailed look at how to use the driver, see the [Guide](./guide-driver).
