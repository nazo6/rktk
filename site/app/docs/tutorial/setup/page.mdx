# Environment setup

First, let's build an environment for using RKTK.

## 1. Install rust

RKTK is built with Rust, so Rust is required; there are various ways to install Rust, but using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is recommended.

After install rust, make sure that the `cargo` command is available.

## 2. Install rktk-cli

`rktk-cli` is command line interface for RKTK. You can install `rktk-cli` using cargo.

```sh
cargo +nightly install rktk-cli --git https://github.com/nazo6/rktk --bin rktk-cli
```

Note that `rktk-cli` requires nightly toolchain.

## 3. Install arm toolchain

To generate UF2 files, the arm toolchain is required.
