rktk is a keyboard firmware framework written in Rust.

Currently, rktk supports nRF52840 and RP2040, and although there are bugs and
performance issues (especially related to split keyboards), it can be used as a
decent keyboard.

This firmware consists of two parts: the core functionality implemented in the
`rktk` crate and the driver that actually interacts with the hardware. This
makes it easy to extend.

## Docs

- [Main site](https://rktk.nazo6.dev/): Very incomplete documentation site
- [API Docs](https://rktk-docs.nazo6.dev/): RKTK Rust API docs
- [Deepwiki](https://deepwiki.com/nazo6/rktk): It contains some incorrect
  content, but considering it is AI-generated, it is excellent.

### Examples

You can find examples in the `examples` directory.

#### Key mapping features

Key mapping features is implemented in `rktk-keymanager` and this crate does not
depend on rktk or embassy.

## Development

### Dependencies

In addition to the dependencies specified [here](https://rktk.nazo6.dev/docs),
to develop rktk, you need to install the following dependencies:

- [cargo-hack](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack): To run matrix check
- [dioxus cli](https://crates.io/crates/dioxus-cli): To run rktk-client
- [cargo-check-delta](https://github.com/nazo6/cargo-check-delta): Used by
  rust-analyzer

### MSRV

#### As library

Unless you enable a specific feature, rktk's MSRV is the latest stable version
of Rust.

In addition, a nightly compiler is required to minimize the binary size.

#### For development

As a library, rktk does not depend on unstable feature, but the rktk repository
workspace depends on cargo's unstable feature. Therefore, nightly is required to
develop rktk.
