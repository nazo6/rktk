<h1 align="center">rktk</h1>
<p align="center">Rust Keyboard Toolkit</p>

rktk is a keyboard firmware framework written in Rust.

Currently, rktk supports nRF52840 and RP2040, and although there are bugs and
performance issues (especially related to split keyboards), it can be used as a
decent keyboard.

This firmware consists of two parts: the core functionality implemented in the
`rktk` crate and the driver that actually interacts with the hardware. This
makes it easy to extend.

#### Key mapping features

Key mapping features is implemented in `rktk-keymanager` and this crate does not
depend on rktk or embassy. Keymap is defined as normal two-dimensional array.
See [keyball61's keymap](./keyboards/keyball-common/src/keymap.rs) for example.

| Feature name           | Status |                                                         |

### Drivers

- "Common" means that the driver is implemented in `rktk-drivers-common`.
  Drivers implemented in `rktk-drivers-common` use embassy traits, so they can
  be easily ported to various platforms.

## Development

See `cargo x --help` and `.vscode/tasks.json` to build firmware and start
development.

### Dependencies

You need to install some tools to generate firmware.

- `arm-none-eabi-objcopy`: Required to generate uf2 firmware for nRF52840
- `wasm-pack`: Required to build rktk-client

### MSRV

rktk actually doesn't depends on nightly feature of _rustc_, but uses nightly
cargo features like `per-package-target`. So, it requires nightly toolchain.

### Creating new keyboard

Currently, there is no guide for building a new keyboard, but you can refer to
the following repository:

- https://github.com/nazo6/rktk-neg
- https://github.com/nazo6/rktk-keyball-rs

Please note that currently driver for regular matrix is not implemented.
