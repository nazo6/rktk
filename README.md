<p align="center">Rust Keyboard Toolkit</p>

rktk is a keyboard firmware framework written in Rust.

Initially, it was a firmware for the
[keyball](https://github.com/Yowkees/keyball), but a driver system was
introduced to make it easy to extend to various keyboards.

Currently, it supports nRF52840 and RP2040, and although there are bugs and
performance issues (especially related to split keyboards), it can be used as a
decent keyboard.

This firmware consists of two parts: the core functionality implemented in the
`rktk` crate and the driver that actually interacts with the hardware. This
makes it easy to extend.

## Development

See `cargo x --help` and `.vscode/tasks.json` to build firmware and start
development.

### Dependencies

You need to install some tools to generate firmware.

- [elf2uf2-rs](https://github.com/JoNil/elf2uf2-rs): Required to generate uf2
  firmware for RP2040
- `arm-none-eabi-objcopy` and `python3`: Required to generate uf2 firmware for
  nRF52840
- `wasm-pack`: Required to build rrp-web

## MSRV

rktk actually doesn't depends on nightly feature of _rustc_, but uses nightly
cargo features like `per-package-target`. So, it requires nightly toolchain.

## Architecture

There are `rktk`, `rktk-drivers-common`, `rktk-drivers-{rp2040,nrf52}` and a
crate for each keyboard.

The `rktk` crate is completely hardware independent and provides the core
functionality of the keyboard.

The `rktk-drivers-common` uses the abstraction of embedded-hal and
embedded-hal-async to provide the basis for drivers that can be used universally
on a variety of chips. This makes porting drivers to various chips very easy.

The `rktk-drivers-*` crate provides drivers for each chip. Most drivers are
wrappings of `rktk-drivers-common`, but some are proprietary implementations,
such as `ws2812-pio`.

Each keyboard crate can then create a driver for the appropriate chip and pass
it to `rktk::task::start` to configure the actual working keyboard firmware. The
only keyboard that currently works is `keyball61-rp2040`, but it is not too
difficult to create your own keyboard by referring to the
`keyboards/keyball61-rp2040` directory.
