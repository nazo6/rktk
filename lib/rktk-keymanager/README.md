# rktk-keymanager

rktk-keymanager is a crate for managing layers and other states.

## Features

I am currently working to support as many features of QMK as possible.

I have also made it more flexible than QMK, so it has features that QMK does not
have, such as the ability to send any two keys at the same time, or to set any
key for Tap and Hold.
